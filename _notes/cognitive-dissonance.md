**Cognitive dissonance is when you experience an internal conflict between your beliefs and/or actions.**
  
  Think of it as the moment you realize that something your doing is very wrong. Not when you know it's wrong but you keep doing it, because then it is validated by your own moral compass, so no conflict there.
  
  Rather when you do/think something you think is right, and then you suddenly (after looking at it from another perspective for example) realize it is not a moral/right deed.
  
  This is one of the worst feelings you can experience, and your mind tries to avoid it any means necessary. This might materialize in you frantically looking for ways to validate it, even with radical/questionable justifications.
  
  *Let's look at it this way, for simplicity:*  
  **We will talk about behaving in a given pattern, and labeling it good/bad, according to your own moral compass.**
  
  We can lay out a few assumptions, or base claims.
  * You behave in a pattern because you find it right (or at least don't find it wrong).
  * You *have* a moral compass, which is sufficient to label said pattern.
  
  So, with those out of the way, let's examine the problem.
  
  You suddenly realize that the label you put on your behaviour is not accurate. (Because what you thought as right is rather unhealthy or immoral for example).
  
  You have two courses of action to chose from.
  1.  You change the pattern, or
  2.  You change the label.
  
  As we know from [[Atomic Habits]], behaviour change is difficult and unpleasant, so most of the time people go with option #2.
  
  While we can sense that this is not a very righteous choice, I would like to take that even further, and name this the #1 reason for the kind of *extreme polarization* we face.
  
  This extreme polarisation stems from the notion that everything is either black or white, there are no grey zones, everything exist in a strict dichotomy (or multichotomy) instead of on a spectrum.
  
  We can see that todays politics is a good example of this kind of trench warfare, each side dug themselves in well, and is not willing to go to the no mans land between the lines to find compromise.
  
  **This also means, that you cannot partially agree with a party.** 
  
  Putting it into the trench war metaphor, if you're wielding a machine gun in some sections of the trench, but try to crawl out to the field in other places, you will end up dead none the less.
  
  So anyone who engages in any kind of thinking faces this dilemma to some degree. If the party I support does something I find immoral or wrong, what will I do?  
  **This is textbook cognitive dissonance.**
  
  Let's look at the options:
  1.  Seize (or reduce) my support towards them.
  2.  Rationalize/justify the deed.
  
  And as discussed, most of the time we go with the comfortable option #2, and internalize some notion that justifies their actions. And if we take this far enough, or do it enough times, we get to the great global paranoia of Nietzsche's post truth world.
  
  he wrongdoings evolve to be so absurd that their justifications has to be just as absurd. Conspiracy theories, forged evidence, false claims, fake accusations are all on the table at this point.
  
  The only way out of this is if we deliberately choose the harder option. We don't turn the blind eye if there is something that we despise.

  This might make it a little easier to avoid demonizing the opposing parties, or God forbid this might even lead to civil discussions between the sides. That would be insane, I know.
