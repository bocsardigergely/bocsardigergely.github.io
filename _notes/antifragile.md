**Booknotes on *Antifragile* by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.**

## Confession
Although this is the book that single-handedly had the biggest impact on how I look at the world, at the time of writing I can't spare the time and go through it again, to make detailed and personal notes.   
This is one of my biggest regrets, not taking more notes on books, and well, not starting this garden earlier.  
  
 But fear not, I will leave you in good hands, if you would like a glimpse into what this book is about.  
 
 **[Here](https://www.nateliason.com/notes/antifragile) is the best booknote/summary I know of.**  
 I hope this little appetizer will make you consider picking up the book, you will not regret it.
