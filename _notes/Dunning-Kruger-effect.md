*This is one of my favorite mental models.*

*I think about it so often, that I rarely notice it as a separate concept, but this alone could serve as a reason to write a note on it here.*
  
  To the concept belongs a beautiful diagram, which I am fairly confident I will have tattoed on myself in the future:

   This diagram sums it up fairly well. The more knowledge you have on a subject, the more you realize the complexity of it, hence becoming less confident in your ability.    
   This seems pretty simple, but let's dig a bit deeper, let's uncover the non-trivial implications of this.
   
## Student life example
   
   Since it is the end of my exam season at the time of writing, let's start with an example from student life.   
  **We all know the stress leading up to a big exam.**  
   But if you examine it carefully, you can realize that the amount of stress is inversely proportional with your confidence regarding your knowledge, presented on the diagram. 
   
   So, when you are in the beginning stages of the exam prep, haven't studied that much, the exam seems doable, even sometimes easy.   
   * *That is the top of the hill.*
   
   Now let's say you spend two days studying the material, and you start to feel familiar, but the stress starts to creep in. The exam seems hard, or more complicated than you first thought.   
  *  *You just started you descent into the valley of despair.*   
   
   You spend even more time studying, being more and more stressed, as the date approaches.     
   For me, it's usually the day before the exam, where I am sure I will fail, I should drop out, it's impossible, I should herd goats in the Transylvanian mountains instead.   
  * *Now you're in the deepest, darkest part of the valley, no sign of hope.*  
   
   This stage is usually followed by some self-loathing pettiness, and the outcry: *"We're all in the hands of God anyways!"*     
   
   And then the exam finally arrives. You get to work, and you are amazed by how well you know everything, the questions seem almost trivial.    
   If you look at the curve, it's self-explanatory,  but you actually acquired quite a bit of knowledge, you just didn't feel like it. 
   
   
   



## Political example
**Ever noticed how everyone seems to be an expert at everything?**  

If you take a careful glimpse into the Facebook comment section (just a glimpse, don't risk losing your hard earned brain cells), under just about any article regarding a problem there are hundreds of people shouting *trivial solutions*.  
**Everybody is an economist, a football-coach, a doctor, an epidemiologist.**  

*How bizarre! How could that be, that all those experts have not thought about my perfect and instant and simple solution?*

Could it be, that they are corrupt? They've got something to gain? 
This is precisely how conspiracies start.

But looking from a Dunning-Kruger standpoint, it's really quite simple. They know little about a topic (don't forget kids, watching two youtube videos is *not* research), so the confidence attached to it will be through the roof.   
They don't understand it deeply enough to realize where their *perfect* solution falls short.  

## Summary

The bad news is, we are all committing such fallacies, it is an unconscious process which cannot be helped.   
The good news is, if you're aware of these biases, you can better prepare yourself against them.
