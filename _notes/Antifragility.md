This concept is dear to me very much.  
It's one of those things that once you see it, you start to see it everywhere, and you're just wondering how did you miss it for so long.  
It originates from Nassim Nicholas Taleb, specifically his book, [[Antifragile]].  
  
It is exactly what you'd think, the opposite of 'fragility'. However, where most people missed is the notion that this opposite is 'robust' or 'hard'. Let's look into that.  
The most important component of fragility, is that shocks (be it literal or metaphorical) harm it. It suffers in a volatile environment.  
  
Now let's see, what would the polar opposite of that be?  
Robust, or hard? No, they don't really care about the environment, so that is a miss. The true opposite would be something that get's better when exposed to shocks. That thrives in a volatile environment.  
  
Think about the Hydra for example, from greek mytholoy. When it is harmed (like someone cuts it's head off) it grows two more. It gets stronger.  
If you look closely, you realize that this notion of benefiting from harm is so counterintuitive, that we don't have a word for it. So here came Taleb, and just coined a new term: *Antifragility*.  
  
One would be right to ask, is this really *that* groundbreaking?  
  
Let's take an example from an economic standpoint:
We have two people, earning exactly the same amount of money in a year.

One is a fancy employee in a big multinational company, the other is a taxi driver. 
Let's look at them from a fragility perspective, basically we try to asses how "stable" their income is. In the event of an economic recession [[Or a global pandemic, hello 2020::rsn]], a taxi driver might suffer some losses, but nothing outstanding, he will probably still be able to pay the bills. 
The employee, on the other hand, is in grave danger. If he gets fired, all of his revenue is gone, and he is completely on his own. 

You probably can see which one of them is more fragile, from this point of view.

But antifragility takes things even further. 
Imagine, if a global pandemic not only didn't hinder the taxi driver's revenue, but increased it!
