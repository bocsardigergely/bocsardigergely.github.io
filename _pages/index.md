# Welcome to my Digital Garden! ðŸŒ±

If you would like to take a glimpse into my mind, I encourage you to find a [tag](/tags) that seems interesting, and dive right in!  

If you're not familiar with the concept, [here](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) is a nice explanation!  
In a nutshell, this is where I can reference all of my thoughts back and forth, without having to scroll through a timeline of notes published. If something relates to my current thought, I will link them together, and then the next time I am going down in that specific rabbit hole, I will see what I saw as connected before.  
If it seems messy, it is mostly because it is messy, that's kind of the whole point. It's a garden, after all, and no matter how well cultivated, they will always have the wilderness in them.
